Servo motors are a type of actuator that can rotate with great precision. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, drones, and model airplanes.

Servo motors work by using a feedback loop to control the position of the motor shaft. The feedback loop consists of a potentiometer, a control circuit, and a motor. The potentiometer measures the current position of the motor shaft. The control circuit compares the measured position to the desired position and sends a signal to the motor to adjust its position.

Servo motors are very precise and can be controlled to very specific positions. They are also very durable and can withstand a lot of wear and tear.

Robotic Applications for Servo Motors
There are many robotic applications for servo motors. Some of the most common include:

Robotic arms: Servo motors are used to control the movement of the joints in robotic arms. This allows robots to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as picking up objects, assembling products, and performing surgery.

Mobile robots: Servo motors are used to control the movement of wheels or tracks in mobile robots. This allows robots to move around their environment and interact with objects.

Humanoid robots: Servo motors are used to control the movement of the joints in humanoid robots. This allows humanoid robots to walk, talk, and interact with humans in a natural way.

Here are some examples of how servo motors are used in robotics:

The Curiosity rover uses servo motors to control the movement of its arm and mast.
The Robonaut 2 is a humanoid robot that uses servo motors to move its arms, legs, and head.
The DaVinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system that uses servo motors to control the movement of its surgical instruments.
The DJI Phantom 4 is a drone that uses servo motors to control the movement of its propellers.
The Traxxas E-Revo is a model airplane that uses servo motors to control the movement of its control surfaces.
