the task was to make some projects using c language and to make a circuit using protues and arduino
i faced a problem at the c project witch required to use operatores on two numbers becuse i had the 2 numbers in float and i needed them in integer in order to get the reminder using %
but i understood the problem while trying to understand how the operator % works
